        <h3>A Tribute to My Father
</h3>
        <p>
            Behind every strong person is a quiet, strong presence — and for me, that’s my father.

He is the foundation upon which I stand. A man of principle, patience, and quiet strength, my father taught me not just how to work hard, but how to stay kind in a world that often forgets to be. He never needed to say much — his actions spoke louder than words ever could. Through his tireless efforts, sacrifices, and unshakable support, he has shaped the person I am becoming every day.

Whether it was staying up late to help, pushing me to dream bigger, or simply being there when I needed someone to lean on, my father has always been a steady light in my life.

This space on my site is more than just a mention — it’s a small way of saying thank you. For the love. The guidance. The strength. And above all, the unwavering belief in me.

        <h3>A Tribute to My Mom</h3>
        <p>If my father is the foundation, my mother is the soul of everything I am.

She is the one who held me when I fell, lifted me when I struggled, and believed in me when I doubted myself. With grace, strength, and an endless supply of love, my mother has been the heartbeat of our home — quiet yet powerful, gentle yet fiercely strong.

Her love has never been loud, but it's always been felt — in the little things, in the everyday sacrifices, and in the way she made everything feel possible, even when it wasn't easy. Her words have guided me, her wisdom has shaped me, and her kindness has grounded me.

This space is for her — a small tribute to the endless love and care she has given me. No words will ever be enough, but this is my way of saying thank you for every moment, every hug, and every bit of strength she passed on to me.

Love you, Mom.</p>

        <h3>A Tribute to My Little Sister</h3>
        <p>In this journey of life, my two little sisters are the laughter in the quiet moments, the joy in the chaos, and the light I didn’t know I needed until they came into my world.

They remind me every day what innocence, curiosity, and unconditional love look like. With their endless questions, wild imagination, and pure hearts, they’ve taught me just as much as I’ve tried to guide them. Watching them grow is like witnessing magic in motion — each step they take, each word they learn, each smile they share feels like a new beginning.

They bring color to my life — sometimes loud, sometimes soft, but always bright. No matter where life takes us, a part of me will always be their protector, their biggest fan, and their guiding hand.

This space is a small piece of my heart for them — for the bond we share, the memories we’ve built, and all the beautiful moments still ahead.

Love you both, always.</p>
